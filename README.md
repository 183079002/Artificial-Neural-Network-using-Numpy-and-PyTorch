# Artificial-Neural-Network-using-Numpy-and-PyTorch
The aim of this task was to create an Artificial Neural Network using Numpy only.
The activation functions that I have used are ReLU and Softmax.
We should be able to design a flexible ANN i.e. number of neurons at each layer and number of layers in our network should be varible.
I have written a very crude form of the code. One can make use of different Classes to carry out small parts of the task.
I am using CIFAR-10 data set which has following classes

airplane 0										

automobile 1									

bird 2									

cat 3								

deer 4									

dog 5

frog 6									

horse 7									

ship 8								

truck 9								

I have written a well commented code, so there should not be any difficulty in understanding each part.

I will be performing image classification for 2 and 5 classes using Numpy and PyTorch as well.
